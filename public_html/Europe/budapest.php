<!-- First Night -->
BUDA BUDA BUDAPEST LETS GET IT. SATURDAY NIGHT BABY. We graciously made our way from Vienna to Budapest on a
smooth train ride in the mid-afternoon. Everyone's thiking it, nobodys saying it... yet.
BIG NIGHT ALERT!! So we arrived at Budapest around 6pm and went through the routine walking from
the train station to the hostel and judging everything along the get th vibes of a new city.
In my mind, Budapest isn't a real place. I mean I associate Hungary with 'How to Train Tour Dragon' and
made up fairytale lands. A little biased but the picture has been painted. Anyway, Jack made a
big move and we are staying at a dope party hostel in the heart of Pest, The Hive. On the walk there we passed through some
sketchy areas and it always smelled like a garbage truck had just made its way through town. Once we got about a
quarter mile from the hostel things became very friendly with enticing restaurants and bars. Our hostel had a real bar in the
center of it and was completely designed to resemble a bee hive. Okay Budapest we get it like your unique
and like to have a good time.

So we checked in at the reception and asked the guy working there what he recommends for a Saturday night.
Easy task. He hits us with the top 4 things to do in Budapest starting with the most expensive.
1. Sparty ~ 45 euro
2. Boat Crawl ~ 20 euro
3. Bingo Pub Crawl ~ 15 euro
4. Bars ~ Free

We just had a big night out in Vienna on Thursday, with only one day of recovery. The
Sparty was by far the coolest thing, 2,000 people going to a massive spa and getting
shit-faced with alcohol and drugs in the hottest swimsuits and bikinis. They had light shows,
fireworks, ho tubs, saunas, you name it. High-energy night with a truly once-in-a-lifetime
experience. I mean anything goes in the water was there slogan, yikes. Betting big on having
a good ratio. Anyways we decided to play ot safe and do the regular bar crawl, Budapest
is famous for having an incredible all-around night life with bard that are made from ruin buildings
back in the world wars. They're huge stone spaces, with the biggest encompassing 21 rooms over three stories.
Big baller mentality tonight and we opted to pay an extra 5 euro to start with unlimited drinks at the
first bar (hostel bar). You already know I'm saving my stomach space for that power hour.

So we got our tickets and went out to dinner at an underground  burger spot in a World War 2 bunker.
My friends really enjoyed it but that wasn't my type of vibe, drinking and eating burgers underground in a city,
but not on Saturday night boys. I also made a poor beer choice there and ordered a half-liter of a raspberry
flavored beer that ended up just being a 12 ounce Rose beer. So that happened... more of a reason to wait until power
hour now. We left the bunker diner and started making our way back to the hostel with about 30 minutes left to start.
Chilling, met a group of Whales guys that were wasted on the rooftop bar playing beer pong, pregaming three days out from
Wales Euro Cup soccer match in Budapest. They were some chaches for sure.

The start of the pub crawl, they handed out a pamphlet with the pub crawl rules and a bingo
board, if you finish 5 bingo challenges then you get a free shot. Some of the challenges were reasonable, like
make a 20 second handshake with a person, or start a limbo contest. A solid third of them were ridiculous though, like
get red lipstick prints on your nipples (from a girl) or lick a person of the opposite sex for at least 5 seconds. All
of them were fun in their own way. I was lucky enough to have a random guy kiss my nose to finish a challenge, not bad.
While we were completeing easy ones at the first hostel, Jack met a group of girls and we introduced ourselves. Two of them
were kind of cute, skinny blondes, and another girl was average. Anyway, a short lived conversation and we focused on getting
our money's worth of the power hour. FINAL TALLEY. Kyle 4.5, Jack 3.5, Alec 3, Aaron 3. Easy money taking the dub.

Onto the next bar. If your not to familiar with drinking, 4.5 Budapest beers is equal to 2.25 liters of beer. I am
not a heavy guy, 6"2 150 pounds, so 2.25 liters is like 5 American beers. Strong start to the night, things become blurry
pretty quickly afterwards. The second bar or maybe the third, I can't distinguish the two apart. My friends are feeling
a lull in energy so they each order a Red Bull vodka. Smart move, worked out Thursday night. I'm feeling great from the beer
so I had one more IPA at the third bar. We were shooting the shit and talking around a table and some drunk guy just
plows into our tabe and takes it and my friends drinks down. I'm on one tonight and was sipping my beer at the time so I
didn't lose my beer. The drunk guy took out three drinks and a tshirt on his way down, so we lightly roughed him up
for some money to buy more drinks. He has a 500hf, which is about 2 American dollars. Fuck that guy. My friends order another
red bull vodka and move on to salvage the night. We checked ou the ruin bar, a starter bar, one story with three dance floors.
Picture an outdoor American bar but made from stone and rock. It was a great place to hangout and we did some dancing
and terrible American Pie kareoke before leaving. Not many girls and expensive drinks, time to go clubbing.

The walk over there was about 10 minutes and totally worth it. I have no memory of arriving at the ruin club, Instant, but remembered
seeing reviews of the club unanimously voting it the most famous club in Budapest and
we got to skip the line since we paid for the pub crawl... TIGHT. I lost my friends as soon as we walked in, 21 floors, three stories,
basically a maze with massive crowds of drunk people. I'm pretty drunk so its not a big deal. So I'm wandering around, checking out
the different rooms, half looking for my friends, half feeling vibes, and half checking out the club ratio. So my drunk math skills
are a litte off, but my luck gets better with each drink, at least tonight. I ran into a girl from the first bar that was also looking
for her friends. Thats a cool story Claire, I don't even know what your friends look like. She grabs my hand and we start making our way
through the rooms. Pushed and shoved my way through a techno dance floor, mosh pit, rap dance floor, top floor balcony, a room of drinking games, and finally came to an outdoor
bar / dance floor area and we took a break. I didny't recognize a single person along the way, low key getting a little nervous. Then I remembered I
hve a girl following and holding onto me so I decide to shoot my shot. I remember 3 things about Claire, she was about my shoulder height, curly blonde hair,
and a good dancer. I made some joke about being stuck there forever and she was a more nervous than I was about being lost in there. Then I gave her a twirl since
we were standing in the middle of a dance floor and she laughed. I took a college level dance class so I know a little bit, enough to flirt. She asked
if I knew the Irish jog, noo fam. But I'm a quick learner. So I played along and let her teach me a little bit, she was leading and doing the pretzel,
it was actually a lot of fun and pretty hot. Then I showed her some North Carolina Shag which was similiar enough that we both knew enough moves to actually dance
together. At some point after doing the slingshot and pretzel she was really into me and we stopped dancing and made-out. The Dance class is paying off already ;)

I don't remember a whole lot from this point on, we took a free shot at each bar and the drinks are catching up to me. I think we made another attempt to find our friends
and actually found Jack and Aaron leaving the mosh pit so I stopped and talked to them. I have no idea what happened to Claire, maybe she found a friend
maybe I just lef her. Bye Claire. There was about 1 girl for every 5 guys so the ratio here is awful and was defintitely intimidating all the girls. All the boys
regrouped and we made our way to the rap dance floor and danced for like an hour or so I think. Then we left, as we were walking home, Aaron turns to me
and says wasnt that the girl you were with? She was standing and looking at her phone about 10 steps down the street. I honestly only remember those 3 things about
her and can't picture her face or body so I didnt know. Went and walked up to her anyway and she recognized me so it was cool. I dont think she ever found her friends
and she clearly wasn't the best with google maps. Her eyes were red like she had been crying so I helped her read the Google maps. I think her emotional
state threw me off so I didn't walk her home. Europe 2, Kyle 0. Ohh well. Walked home with the boys and then went out to find a sober-up Kebab for some food. Walked around
for about an hour after getting the kebab. Got hoem at like 4:30 in the morning, another late one without too much action. Saving it for Prague and Berlin.

<!-- First Day -->
Woke up at like 9:30am feeling really light-headed but good other than that. Got an early morning shower and some water before heading down
to the concierge desk to get a map of Budapest and start planning for the day. Alec was the only other person off so we brainstormed some ideas together for the day.
Decided on St. Stephen's, chain bridge, royal palace, and Fishermans Bastion. As the day went on we started boarding the struggle bus. My stomach was not to happy
and decided that it wasn't going to be hungry today so I ate an ice crream Chimi Cake, frozen snickers, and a night Kebab. Not much happened today, we were just some
hungover hooligans walking around Budapests. Essentially covered like 4 miles of walking over the day and stumbled from overlook to overlook taking a 10 minute break
at each one, usually with the same view lmao. I decided to go to bed kinda early, like 11pm and get some sleep for the night.

<!-- Second Day -->
Woke up early. DO IT FOR THE VLOG BABY. Walked the places we went yesterday after getting an espresso shot and did my best to energetically
vlog about the places. Covered the intro, post-intro, covered the chain bridge really well, a little bit of St Stephens, and the Fishermans Bastion.
I really need to save the party night for the last night and vlog he first two days so I'm not hungover vlogging. Anyways, had to hustle walk back to lock
the Airbnb and then meet the boys back at St Stephens for a 10:30am walking tour. A little toasted after that, and the walking tour covered
the exact same route I took that morning but with added history and humor. Finally we finished that and I continued my bizarre eating streak of having
a lunch that consisted of a pina coloda, a milkshake, and a quinoa salad and avocado. Then we checkout out the Hungarian Parliament which was actually really cool.
The gothic architecture there makes it feel old yet modern with the marble material. Extremely beautiful building, and best of all, it had free bathroooms
with cold water. Win win. Alec and I checked out the statues surrounding the Parliament and then walked along the Danube river. A little salty
we didnt get to see the shoes of the Danube but its really just for the picture so I'll survive. Later we caught back up with the boys and made
our way home.

We had to try the infamous Budapest spas. We went to the same on that hosts the massive parties on Saturday nights. The Szenchy. This place is unreal. It has two massive thermal
outdoor pools at 29 Celsius with a lap swimming pool in the middle. Surrounding the pool deck is a huge wall of buildings that had about 10 different pools on each of the
four sides at different temperatures. Some were as cold as ice baths, other warmer than the outdoor thermal pool deck and most a few degrees different. One experience you
for sure cannt get in the US is the sauna, like it was so mf hot. It said 80 degrees celsius, which is like 176 degrees Fahrenheit. BIG YIKES. I only lasted 3 minutes
in there before stumbling out fearful for my life. Like my toes were boiling, my lungs felt burnt, and my skin was tingling. You dry off in the first minute, become
covered in sweat during the second minute, and then I felt like the sweat was boiling my skin on the third minute. There was a guy that stayed in there for 5 minutes
that was sunburnt red and couldn't open his eyes he was so sweaty. Pain city is a better name for that place. Anyways we tried the thermal pool twice, the sauna once, and the ice
bath once before leaving. If you go to Budapest you have got to try the spas though, 10/10.

After the spa we were dehydrated and has another lazy night, just got Kebabs and chilled in the hostel. Slow monday nights and I right. I actually couldnt fall asleep until 12:30am
for some reason and stayed awake working on the Budapest vlog. I still have a bad cold and almost feel like I felt better when I was hungover yesterday than
being well rested today. Think less do more.
