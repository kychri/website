FIRST HOSTEL OF THE TRIP LETS GO! We had a full day of travel from Grenoble to
Nice that demanded bus and train hopping from the French Alps to
the Mediterrean Coast. With France being about the same size as Texas, this took
a combo of planning and lucky bus routes. We finally strided in at 8:30 on a Saturday nght. I made
sure to book a party hostel that was a few blocks from the coast.

Let me paint the picture, we had four guys that had just completed a famous Tour de France
finish attempted by only the most premiere cyclists in the world. A test of
fitness and athleticism to see if we had what it took as fresh out of the oven
post-collegiate athletes to complete a 37 mile ride that finishes up 21 switchbacks
over the last 9 miles. Somehow, someway, we were able
to dish out enough confidence to each other during the ride to finish the climb at 7000ft.
We were on top of the world looking over snow-capped mountains with a professional level
fitness acheivement, a perfect recipe for celebration.
Then, we rested on a train like caged race horses for 12 hours and arrived in a new
Mediterrean city notorious for party bars that draw in the worlds most beautiful people.
<p>
<h2>BIG NIGHT ALERT!</h2>
<!-- Going out -->
<p>
We dropped our bags, grabbed a shower, dressed like some 11/10's and picked up
tickets for a bar crawl along the Mediterrean coast featuring 4 bars and a club. We showed up
right at the end of the first bar and immediately chatted up an Aussie
that was taking a 2 month Euro trip while we were walking to the next stop. The bar crawl was shooting
a promo video for the hostel and we stopped to play a game, splitting into two and seeing who could
crowd-surf pass a person through their line the fastsest. Europeans know to have fun with strangers.
As we were ordering a round of beers at the 2nd bar the bartender dished out 3 fire flaming shots
to three cute girls. Two of my friends steered the conversation away from the Aussie lad and
towards the new girls. I decided to let my friends have some fun and
kept talking with the Aussie until the group started the walk towards the 3rd bar,
hit him with a CHEERS MATE and then went back to my friends. Following a
herd of tipsy college-aged people, we walked the tight city-streets of Nice until arriving at the 3rd bar.
We quickly settled in and met two guys that were from Duke and Colorado while bonding over
American music classics being played by a live guitarist from Nasheville TN. Cool guys, but never to be seen again
after making the walk over to the 4th bar. Once we got there, by far the coolest bar, we
found two Irish guys at the fourth bar. I hit my max limits on guy talk for the night and
began picking up a conversation with the 3 girls from the second bar with my friend Aaron.
Turns out they were from Charleston, SC and about to start their senior year of college.
We smoothly made it through the traveler talk and started getting their names before it was time to head
to the last club. We took some pictures with the group along the way and I was able to be
a little more friendly with an Italian girl from Charleston during the walk to the club.
I had a lot of fun talking with them and got their numbers before tipping them off
and heading home for the night. Tomorrow was a bucket-list day with the 90th Monaco
Grand Prix on deck and we had plans to make it home after a few drinks by 1am. Lesson 1: In Europe,
big nights don't end at 1am, not even 2am. By this point it was 3:00am and we started swimming in our birthday suits in the
Mediterrean Sea. While drying off, we skipped some rocks off a beautiful stony beach and
we made back to the hostel by 4:00am.
</p>

<p>
The next morning was one of those were you wake up with the fingers crossed that the brain turns on. I was lightheaded and
couldn't decide if I was still feeling good from the night before or if the Mediterrean
Sea had magic hangover healing powers. No point in entertaining that thought further because we had a hude day ahead of us
and there was only one option... rally. The girl next to me in the hostel was bustling at 9:30am and I decided
to wake up and grab an early breakfast and shower before catching a train ride over to Monaco. The Monaco Grand Prix is the most popular F1 Racing event in the world.
It draws the worlds wealthiest and even the royal and political leaders to a tiny country of 0.85sq miles to
discuss racing and business.
</p>
<!-- Monaco GP -->
<p>
One step off the train from France to Monaco and Verizon hit me with an update message "Welcome to Monaco! This country has no
international phone plan, data is $2.00/MB and texts are $0.50/message". Way to go Monaco, an immediate announcement
that this land is only meant for luxury spenders. Instant airplane mode. How hard can it
be to navigate through 0.85sq miles? It took two Google Maps screenshots to see every street and make our way around the city.
With the the prestigious social opportunity comes high ticket prices, I mean a couple thousand, and we were on
a budget of $10 for tickets. Luckily I was able to find a blog from a local that recomended getting a beer at a
resturant where you can see about 5 car lengths of the race, good for about 1 second per lap. The city
blocked off every other angle of the race from the entire city unless you had tickets. We decided to buy a beer and
watch as much of the race as we could.
</p>
<!-- Post Race -->
<p>
After the race we checked out the Oceanographic musuem and took some insane pictures of mega-yachts in the harbor
The museum had an outside Game of Thrones themed garden that overlooked the coast and historic musuem. We happened to run into a Texas oil millionaire
who took a picture of us and told us the race is cool but he'd rather see the musuem instead. Charisma
skills to the max. About an hour after the race they started reopening the city to the public and let us view the track
from the balcony viewings. It was a life-questioning view that encompassed the Monaco track, the prestigious yacht harbor, and the city's buildings on a hill.
I was lost in the thought of how such an event can take place and the most powerful people in the world can all gather
in such a small place like Monaco that essentially served as their playground for a day. There was a clear socio-economic divide
that anyone, even a small child, could distinguish. I loved every moment of absorbing the super-wealth
atmosphere but knew that this day could have accomplished so much more if put to good use by the people with tickets.
After the race trained back to Nice and got a light dinner with some ice cream before calling it a day.
Rest days are needed in Europe, just because you are in a dope place doesn't mean you have to be doing something
incredibl each night. It was a hard thought to wrap my brain around but my body thanked me the next morning.

<!-- Walking tour / Nice hike / Cards -->
<p>
Monday... like days matter when your backpacking. Woke up and started off the day with a quick 60 minute
run to do some sort of activity from my normal American routine. Ran pretty quick, about 6:20 pace average,
beach speed is a real thing, and was actually pretty tired afterwards. Luckily I was able to see a lot of
Nice during the run and found a super cool cliff jumping spot into the Mediterrean Sea. Aaron signed us up
for a walking tour at 11am and we met with a new group of people on the tour that ended up composing
our social group for the day. We met a Vlogger / Youtuber from San Diego known to be a
travelling musician that has 36K subscribers and also two girls fromCanada that are going to college in the US.
The walking tour was free and only took an hour so we made plans with the group to go on a day hike along the coast.
We ended up stopping at the cliff jumping spot and taking a few quick jumps. When we got to the spot, there were about
10 high schoolers that were drinking beer and trying to build enough courage to make the jump.
It was easy to distinguish who the ringleader was since he was the one chuggin beer and actually jumping. Skipping
school to drink and cliff dive, must be the French coast life of a teenager. The vlogger brought his camera
on the hike and filmed our cliff diving section and cool parts of the hike. That footage is going to be sick
and I can't wait to see it. After our hike we stopped and grabbed lunch right on the harbor, I opted for a Focaccia
pizza and a beer. After skipping lunch, I felt okay with spending some extra Euro to really enjoy
a good meal with soon to be friends. Afterwards, we lived life on the edge and rode the Eurail train without tickets
back to Nice since lunch was a little pricy and the train came when we got to the station. We hadn't been ticketed
yet for trains from Nice and I was a little anxious about pressing our luck. The train was overcrowded and
everything went well, it felt like a childish act but brought a lot of emotion and joy to the group
in the process. Once we got back I was full of pizza and had about 20 miles on the legs so I laid down in
a hostel bed for a bit before taking a shower. Recooperated before heading to the hostel bar and endulging in 1.50e beers
with our newly founded friends. We ended up having a few drinks and playing cards throughout the night since all
of us were traveling at 8am the next day. I enjoyed meeting the three people, Abby, Natasha, and Legend, but wasn't
in my best social mood and was quiet for most of the day. I have tended to find that when the days that I run
tend to be when I am the least social, unless I get a coffee. Anyways, it was  pretty fun night and we saved some cash
instead of going out for drinks, but I am a little unsettled that we never made real progress on flirting with
French girls. That was certainly a bucket list type of experience.
