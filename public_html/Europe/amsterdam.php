<h2> THE DAM </h2>
<p>
  Everyone has heard something from somebody about Amsterdam. Everythings legal,
red light district, canals, space cake, black bikes, theft, parks, drugs, touristy, you name it. A tear just trickled down
the right side of my sunburnt face. This is the last city on my college graduation
euro tour. The month long stunt is over. Even the smallest snap back to reality is hitting each of us more than we could have anticipated.
All the pub crawls, espresso shots, kebabs, beers, tequila shots, 5am nights, were overlooked and never thought about. We
were present in the moment, hangovers didn't exist, seizing every second of every day to maxmize every oppotunity of enjoyment.
No place I'd rather be.
We're taking a full four days in Amsterdam, which is the longest we've planned to stay in
any city. It feels absolutely incredible to be back in a city that is under 90 degrees.
Like my body can withdraw from constant sweat mode and actually shutdown enough to sleep at night.
Pure ecstacy, even more so than in Berlin. Had to do it.

<h2> The First Day </h2>
<p>
  After traveling through the club capital of the world on Friday and Saturday nights,
  great practice for bachelor parties by the way, we were looking to lay low
  and recoup ourselves during the first day in Amsterdam. We arrived in Amsterdam and got off the train right at Central Station,
  which is borders the largest canal, and immediately were hit with a view overlooking north Amsterdam. A
  a first impression in Amsterdam. A bike

  Its a Sunday and Monday, the perfect time to relax and
  casually bike around the city. We're meeting up with Coleman and Emma, two friends of the the twins that
  are current med school students, so we decided to wait in the hostel for them to arrive.
