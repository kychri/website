<h1>
  BERLIN
</h1>

<div class="journal">
<!-- First Night -->
<p>
Do you want to see what the world would be like if everyone was openly progressive?
What about if the capital of a country was run on drug money? Or a place where everyone
lives for Friday and Saturday nights? How about the largest, loudest, and stylish night
clubs that has the world's best stereo system and never closes?
Welcome to Berlin. Where the clubs open at midnight on Friday and don't close until noon on Monday.
Nonstop clubbing in places that are 5, 9, even 11 stories tall. An old abandoned power
plant, a renovated dog food manufacturing plant, or a once historical circus ground.
These places come alive at 1-2am on Friday and can deliver ecstacy in the forms of drug,
techno, and free-sex until Monday morning.
</p>

<p>
Of course there are people alive during the day too. There is more to the city than its
world-class club scene. Everyone needs a break from partying they have a special word
for that in Berlin, they call it the week. The people of Berlin operate small shops
and snall businesses to pass the time and save enough money to buy enough alcohol,
molly, and cocaine for the next big weekend. With a lifestyle like this, theres no
reason to save for retirement. Old people do not exist in Berlin.
The city stretches a length equivalent to New York City's Manhattan with no easily distinguishable downtown.
</p>

<strong> MY STORIES: </strong>
I felt on edge the entire time in this city. You're never safe, people are always
watching you, judging you, just as I was to them. I can't tell if the people of
Berlin wear their personalitys through a transparent sleeve, or if the city has
brainwashed them to think they are expressing themselves in their own style.
The in-style for Berlin is a grungy yet hipster black fashion. Its as far away
from prep as it could be, but you can't look like you're poor either. Its a dark,
drug induced style... similair to the goth people in high school, but with people
that have actual personalitys. I certainly didnt belong in Berlin, but it made me
want to try harder than any other city.

<strong> SATURDAY NIGHT </strong>
Have you heard about the clubbing scebe in Berlin? Its one of the biggest, eccentric
places to party in the world. Its home to Bergain, which is the most famous club in the
world and has the same world-famous bouncer every weekend. So I've done about 4 hours
of research on how the hell we, 4 traveling tourists with only a backpack full of wrinkled
clothes, are going to convince a bouncer that we belong in their special Berlin club.
My friends know the Berlin clubs are filled with unique people and street drugs, but
don't know that the bouncers let in about 25% of people. There are unspoken rules that
need to be followed to have a chance, like you can't be drinking, use your phone, or
act excited in line. Basically put on your best, bored and sober face and cross your toes.
</p>

<p>
<strong> MY MEMORY: </strong>
A different kind of turning up. Rule #1 know the DJ. Rule #2 dont be drinking or act drunk.
I made sure to drink light for the night. I knew it would help keep me awake and going later
and it would also give me the best chance of getting into clubs. The twins and Jack don't think
the same way... well I know who made the right decision. Always bet on yourself. Now we showered
up and Im talking them through the style of Bergain but its going right over their head, like
they got the dark theme but not the goth/punk. Like you want to be as far away from preppy as
possible but still have your style show. Anyways, I put on some dark chinos, Nike Air Max, and
a dark colored American Eagle shirt. I feel confident in these clothes, its not Bergain best
style but its not too far off. Jack was on one last night and bought some Charlie, Im actually
more excited than I thought to do this before going out. Like Ive never done it before a night
that has a high potential for Molly. It was an exhilarating head space to live a night filled
to the highest potential. Jack broke it up and made the 4 lines for the 4 of us and started
blaring music. His high choice of music already had me rolling, like he played the NFL music
remix while he took his line and then played the perfect song while I took mine. Cocaine.
I waited for the chorus and ripped the line off his iPad, through a 50 euro bill. Im a badass
I know, especially as I write this with the comedown headache the next day. So after we're
all sobered up and ready to go clubbing we gather, return our bikes from earlier in the day
and walk to Bergain. We're buzzing hard walking through the streets of Berlin at midnight,
getting ready to shoot our shot at the biggest club in the world. After having Jack lead us
past it, what a surprise am i right, we finally walked around the backside of the renovated
power factory. This building is unlike anything I have ever seen. Its a combination of a massive
mauseloum building and flashing nightmare from hell. You can't hear any music from the 11 story
factory but even walking by it the ground is trembling a little and I can feel the bass is my chest.
Or maybe its just the cocaine. No, the energy of Bergaine is known for being the highest in the
world. We walked by the front of the line, past the world famous bouncer Sev, and then kept walking
and walking. After passing like 500 people we finally reached the end of the queue, straight back
from the Bergain entrance. Unfortunately Jack makes mistake #2, he buys 4 0.5L from the concession
stand targeting inexperienced Bergain tourists. Rule # fucking 2. Well we're far enough back in
line maybe no one will notice. Bad karma and none of us needed a beer after a line of coke, Jack
come on bro. We chat softly and meet the cute couple behind us, an italian guy and a girl from
Washington DC. They are totally dressed the part of Bergain with piercings, chains, and black clothes.
They gave us a good club rec in case Bergain didnt work out, they had done their research like me and
knew we had a higher chance of getting into the club by fighting our way through the 4 scariest looking
men on the planet then by them waving us in.
