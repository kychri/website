    Get a firsthand experience of what its like to travel and explore the best
    of 8 countries in Europe: France, Monaco, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Hungary,
    Czech Republic, Netherlands. My friends and I backpacked across Europe and
    documented the highlights of the trip along with each country's culture
    and what made it unique.

    I traveled with three friends to 11 different cities across central Europe
    after graduating from college. We explored the main tourist attractions before
    renting bikes and exploring the local secrets of each place. Thoughts, pictures,
    and videos of each city is included. Check out each countries page to get a
    modern look into what the European cities and what they have to offer.
