MUNICH BABY!! The German roots are coming out. I am 75% German and 25% Irish so
being in my descendants country feels some type of way. Like I'm suddenly feeling an
itch in my throat that water can't quite scratch. It'll probably take a liter of
wheat beer to get it out ;) First up is getting settled in the hostel and meeting
Alec and Aaron's friend Coleman and his girlfriend Abby. Some irrevalent background knowledge.
Both Colemand and Abby are in med school to become doctors. Power couple. Anyway we met up with them
at the hostel, dropped our bags, each grabbed a shower while getting to know each other and then went
down to the hostel for a happy hour beer. Or two. Or three. I mean its kinda crazy, like you get
a half liter of delicious, heavy,  beer for 2.50 euro. I'm learning that after a travel day, or a day where
I get some time to  myself to think, edit vlogs, code, just being an introvert, I feel incredibly social
and can talk to anyone after. So I decided not to sit with my friends and instead sit down next to two strangers (guys)
and see what they've been up to in Munich. One guy was a computer science major from British Columbia, Canada and
talked about home, finance, and Australia. Average conversation but enjoyable. The other was some 19 year old guy from
south of Oxford and he was a total douche. Like I asked where he was from and he said some small town ass
name and I asked what it was close to and he said it was 20 minutes south of Oxford. I was like oh cool I've heard of Oxford
and the college, whats it like? "I'm 19 and not in a universityso how would I know... " like okay bro. Well how has it been growing up
in Oxford. Well I don't live in Oxford. Like gtfo here with that sas level. We were cool though, hard to talk to with his
caustic tone though. The bartender was a super cool Aussie who gave some pro tips and then recommended a beer hall to
hit up once happy hour ended. They served dinner so we headed that way at 8pm. The dinner was mindblowing, like I spent
13 euros on dinner and ordered a LITER OF BEER for 6 euro. Had a great time with my friends and getting to know Coleman
and Abby. We ate dinner right next to the beer hall, and it was Friday night so
